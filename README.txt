the files that will be used once I get this thing together will be

index.html : just the main page of the site, all output will be in the console

csp_solver.js : simple backtracking constraint satisfaction solver

create_matrix.js : gives each position all the possible notes that could possibly go there based on some rules defined by the user
                    
create_constraints.js : the logic to take user defined rules and convert them into constraints to be tested in the solver (untested, and incomplete)
                        
test.js : a file where I was testing the various components (currently a total mess)
